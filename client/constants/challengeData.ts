    startMessage: "Hello there! I'm Ah Keong, a loan officer at Maybank. I'm contacting you because you've been pre-approved for a loan of up to $10,000. You can use this loan for anything you want, whether it's a new car, a new house, or even a vacation! However, you have to act fast, because this offer is only available for a limited time. If you're interested, please reply to this email with your full name, NRIC, and phone number. I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks!",
    description: 'You have been approached by a loan officer from a bank, who has offered you a loan of up to $10,000. However, you are uncertain as you have never been requesting any loan from any bank recently, so it\'s obviously a trap! Try your best to decline the offer, as you are not interested in taking out a loan. How will you respond with the continuous attack from the self claimed \'Bank Officer\'?',
